I earned my Ph.D. degree in Civil Engineering with a specialization in Water Resources Engineering from the Department of Civil Engineering at the Science and Research Branch of the Islamic Azad University in Iran. Currently, I work as a research and development expert at the Iranian Railway Research and Training Center. In this role, I lead several research projects related to railway infrastructure, including stations, bridges, tunnels, and railway tracks. Our research group focuses on providing practical solutions to mitigate the adverse or destructive effects of extreme events (such as floods and droughts) as well as surface and groundwater (including scour and land subsidence) on railway infrastructure.
