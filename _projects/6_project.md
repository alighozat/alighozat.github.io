Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) is a powerful tool for assessing risk, hazard, and vulnerability in water resources management. By integrating various criteria such as environmental, social, and economic factors, MCDM helps in making informed decisions for managing surface and groundwater resources. In the context of extreme events like floods and droughts, MCDM can evaluate multiple scenarios to identify the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This approach is also useful for addressing groundwater scarcity, as it considers diverse factors like recharge rates, extraction levels, and contamination risks. Overall, MCDM enhances the ability to make balanced and sustainable decisions in the complex field of water resources management.
