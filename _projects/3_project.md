Flood inundation mapping and forecasting are critical for disaster management and urban planning. By integrating satellite imagery, hydrological models, and real-time weather data, scientists can accurately predict flood extents and timings. These maps help authorities to identify high-risk areas, plan evacuations, and allocate resources effectively. Advanced technologies, such as machine learning and remote sensing, enhance the precision of flood forecasts, enabling timely warnings and reducing potential damage. Overall, continuous improvements in data collection and analysis are making flood management more proactive and efficient, ultimately safeguarding lives and property.
