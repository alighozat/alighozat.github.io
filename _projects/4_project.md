Groundwater resources management is vital for ensuring sustainable water supply, especially in regions prone to water scarcity. By employing techniques such as aquifer recharge, monitoring groundwater levels, and regulating extraction, scientists and policymakers can maintain the balance between usage and replenishment. Advanced technologies, including remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), aid in mapping and analyzing groundwater resources. Effective management practices help prevent over-extraction, contamination, and depletion of groundwater reserves. Overall, a comprehensive approach to groundwater management supports long-term water security and environmental health.
